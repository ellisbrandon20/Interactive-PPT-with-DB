IDEA:

initilialize:
	the listbox initialize assumes that if there are songs already loaded on ppt. that it is all slides that are in the database. 

	- can change this feature later



bible: 

	- try to make the add ppt slide into a sub routine so you dont have copied code!!!!
		- used in add_song and add_verse



WORKS: 
	- putting chr count  < 275 in one slide
	- superscript v#s

NO WORK:
	- doesnt add a single verse
	- doesnt add verses after the first set
